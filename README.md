This repository contains a class that I coded for Sophomore year applied math research. 
The code is an implementation of the Stommel box model, a simplified mathematical system
for predicting ocean climate phenomena. The class can take in parameters for the model,
then calculate equilibrium points as well as simulate how the system changes over time.

I wrote this code under the guidance of Professor Richard McGehee.
